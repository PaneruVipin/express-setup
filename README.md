# Express Setup

Express Setup is a framework that simplifies the setup and configuration of your Express.js applications. It introduces several keywords and conventions to streamline common tasks and improve code readability.

## Keywords and Conventions

### Special Keywords

The following keywords are special to this framework setup. Please do not assign variable names using these keywords:

- `appRouter`: Use this keyword for defining routes in the `routes` directory. No need to import or export `appRouter`, just define your routes.

- `respond`: Utilize this keyword for smart response handling without relying on Express arguments.

- `Exception`: Employ `exception` for smart error throwing without depending on Express arguments.

- `resolveHttp` and `resolveHttpOrFail`: These keywords are designed for smart handling of promises and asynchronous code.

### Advantages of Express Setup

1. **Streamlined Route Definition**: Use the `appRouter` keyword to define routes in the `routes` directory without the need to import or export. This simplifies route handling.

2. **Efficient Response Handling**: Utilize the `respond` keyword for intelligent response handling, reducing dependencies on Express arguments.

3. **Error Handling Simplified**: The `Exception` keyword simplifies error throwing, making it more intuitive and less reliant on Express arguments.

4. **Asynchronous Code Management**: `resolveHttp` and `resolveHttpOrFail` provide effective solutions for handling promises and asynchronous code.

5. **Configuration Directory**: The framework includes a `config` directory for smart configuration management.

6. **Other Features**: Explore additional features such as environment variables (`Env`) and file handling with `req.files`.
